        <p>Recent graduate from <a href="https://codeclan.com/">CodeClan's</a> 16 week intensive programming course in Edinburgh.  Currently looking to develop my skills learned on the course within the workplace environment.  Below, you can find some example pieces from my portfolio, with links to the corresponding github pages.</p>

        <p class="blurbs">In the first week long project for the CodeClan course, I was tasked to create an application to help a record store owner (Harvey) keep track of their inventory. To achieve this, I utilised Ruby with the Sinatra framework for the front end, while using PostgreSQL for the database.</p>
        <p class="blurbs">The app allowed for the user to input, edit, and delete artists, albums and stock, and the database schema was organised as a one to many relationship between artists and albums, and another one to many relationship between albums and stock.</p>
        <p class="blurbs">The user would be warned if stock levels are running low with a colour coordinated stock level indicator. Further, the capability to add album artwork was incorporated as an additional feature, in order to make the design more interesting.</p>

        <p class="blurbs">In this class exercise, I wanted to explore the potential of pulling various randomised pieces of data through from text files. This was my first attempt at creating a multiple page Android mobile app, so I wished to incorporate several pages of fun filled puppy madness!!</p>

Our own disease API was combined with the Google Maps API in order to display markers on a world map that shows the global spread of diseases over time.</p>
        <p class="blurbs">This project was made in JavaScript, using MongoDB for the database and HighCharts for the graphs.</p>

        <p class="blurbs">In the final project at CodeClan, I wished to consolidate the material which I had learned over the previous 2 weeks while studying React and Rails. My aim was to create a travel blog, utilising Rails to manage the database, while practicing managing a large number of components with REACT.</p>
